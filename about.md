Hi, my name is [Mark John Buenconsejo](https://www.google.com.ph/search?q=Mark+John+Buenconsejo), and i have been coding
since 1997. Through these years, i have coded using
many programming languages, platforms, libraries, and tools.

I made this site, as a way to showcase my work, and to share, what
others might find useful.

Learn more about me, at [http://markjeee.com](http://markjeee.com). If
you want to get in touch, send me a message on [Telegram](https://t.me/markjeee) or via [e-mail](mailto:hi@markjeee.com).

## Codeworthy

A list of stuffs i have worked on:

[nlevel/cableguy](https://github.com/nlevel/cableguy) - compile configuration files based on a template and a cabling DB. Cabling DB is a key-value store, defined using a ruby-based DSL, or via a cabling values file, which is a YML file typically stored in the `home_path`.

[nlevel/bobby](https://github.com/nlevel/bobby) - a super Chef cookbook, for quickly provisioning system environments, based on known setups (Ubuntu-based). So far, built environments for PHP and Ruby.

[nlevel/thomas](https://github.com/nlevel/thomas) - thomas the docker builder. a mix of docker build scripts for various services/frameworks used in a continuous delivery pipeline.

[nlevel/devkit](https://github.com/nlevel/devkit) - a helper code for running docker containers for dev environments.

[markjeee.github.io](https://github.com/markjeee/markjeee.github.io) - this website, a place i share code and do experiments.

[exercism-solutions](https://github.com/markjeee/exercism-solutions) - my answers to challenges in exercism. as they say, practice makes perfect.

[cebucodecamp/uno](https://github.com/cebucodecamp/uno) - this is a programming exercise for anyone who wants to try Haskell by implementing the [Uno game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)). It's designed to be a progressive way of learning, with test codes provided, and the coder just needs to implement the functions to pass the tests.

[cebucodecamp/exploding](https://github.com/cebucodecamp/exploding) - another programming exercise, similar to uno above, but based in the [Exploding Kittens](https://www.explodingkittens.com/) card game.

[vagrant-forward_ports](https://github.com/markjeee/vagrant-forward_ports) - a vagrant plugin, to easily configure port forwards (or reverse forwards), between the host and guest VM, using SSH.

[rubygems-mirror](https://github.com/markjeee/rubygems-mirror) - a forked rubygems-mirror to support custom location of config file.

[Socket.IO-rack](https://github.com/markjeee/Socket.IO-rack) - a server-side, rack-middleware for the Socket.IO JS framework. A bit old, and unmaintained.
